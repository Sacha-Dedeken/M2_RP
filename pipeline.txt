
0) Dataset analysis

 - Localisation, type of exam and type of patients
 - Number of devices
 - Number of patients
 - Patient auxiliary covariates
 - Targets
 - Variability in data

1) Pre-process the data

 - Mask on the organ and the ROI
 - Standardization / Z-score based on organ or ROI
 - Normalization / [0,1] based on organ or ROI
 - Discretization / [0, 32] based on organ or ROI
 - Histograms extractions
 - Train-test split (on each device)

D1_T, D1_E, D2_T, D2_E (training / evaluation)

2) GAN Training

 - Propose a GAN architecture
 - Train it on D1_T+D1_E, D2_T
 - Input D2_T, D2_E and generate D2_T_G, D2_E_G

3) Sanity check

- Measure D2_TE_mean (source), D1_TE_mean (target), D2_T_G_mean (train gen), D2_E_G_mean (eval gen)
- Check if the score (based on chi-square distance) is positive (necessary, not sufficient)

4) Radiomics Extraction

 - Extract radiomics from all sub datasets (D1 -> R1, for radiomics), to answer following questions:
	* R1_T : "does the classifier is good on its training data?" 
	* R1_E : "does the classificer is good on new data from the same device?"
	* R2_T+R2_E : "does the classifier is good on new data from a different device without harmonization?"
	* R2_T_G : "does the classifier is good on new data harmonized, from the GAN training data?"
	* R2_E_G : "does the classifier is good on new data harmonized, unseen by the GAN in training phase?"
 - Train a classifier with R1_T, evaluate its accuracy on all sub datasets radiomic
 - Conclude absolute and relative performances, with or without harmonization
